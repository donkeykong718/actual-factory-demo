# Fills the task queue with the ASCII-art work the factory will chew through.
#
# What this opens by default:
#   - 2 epic beads (Letters a–m, Letters n–z)
#   - 26 letter tasks (a.md ... z.md, split across the two epics)
#
# ADR 0001 also allows numbers 1–100. Those epics are written below but left
# commented out, because 126 tasks is a lot of queue to look at when you only
# intend to run two or three of them. Uncomment them if you want the full set.
#
# Each child task is parented to its epic (--parent <epic-id>) and stamped
# with metadata.target_file = "ascii/<filename>" so agents can locate the file
# they own without parsing their own task title.
#
# Run this from the rig root, after `gc rig add` has initialized its beads
# database and before you hand any work to an agent:
#   ./seed.sh
